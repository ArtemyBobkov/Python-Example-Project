# Example Python Project

## Overview

This project is a simple library system simulation implemented in Python. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. The system allows for the creation and management of books and library members, with functionality to register members and allow them to read books.


It is generated entirely by ChatGPT (including the previous paragraph), with some minor modifications by me. It is FORBIDDEN to submit code like this in your study projects, they must be done by yourself and show your own work (and be more complex and functional, of course).

Did you expect to find here? Poor you! My reviewer hasn't approved my pull request yet, so there is nothing to see in `master` branch. Visit `develop` to see the actual code ;)
